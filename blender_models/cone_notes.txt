The cone is 2 units tall. Originally, the cone was set so its base was at the origin of Blender's coordinate frame. I moved the cone down -.5 units, so the approximate center of mass of a cone (located 1/4 of the way up the cone) was at the origin of Blender's coordinate frame. I then zeroed the location with CTRL+a and then Apply -> Location. Note that is isn't a solid cone and has a base as well, so the center of mass probably wouldn't be exactly 1/4 the way up the cone.
